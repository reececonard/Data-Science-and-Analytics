The final architecture included 2 hidden layers with 3 neurons each combined with the Learning rate of 0.003 and Activation of ReLU. I varied the different Activations but both the linear and Sigmoid would bottom out pretty quickly and not do a good job of converging. I had the best success with Tanh and ultimately the best success with ReLU. I eneded up stopping at 003,252 epochs as it did not seem to be going any lower and I could have probably stopped it sooner than that. Arcitecture is very important versus the decision surfaces if you want it to run correctly and get the results that you are looking for."
